# Zac Programming Language
Zac is a simple programming language that compiles to js.

## Why
It starts out as a frustration with the constant increasing complexity of TypeScript. But now I just do it for the sake of fun in exploring different kinds of ideas from many different programming language that I personally love.

## Planned features
- Robust strict type system
- Pattern matching
- Exhaustive checking
- Records
- Chainable `.await`
